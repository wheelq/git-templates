## Issue-Driven Development

### Working with GitHub Issues

- **Reference issues in commits**: `git commit -m "feat: add feature (#123)"`
- **Link PRs to issues**: Include `Closes #123` or `Fixes #123` in PR description
- **Ask about issues**: "What are the requirements for issue #123?"
- **Create branches from issues**: Use `scripts/create-issue-branch.sh <issue-number>`

### Branch Naming from Issues

- Format: `feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>` or `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
- Example: `feature/123-add-config-validation`

### Branch-Based Workflow (CRITICAL)

- **ALWAYS create a branch before making commits**
- **NEVER commit directly to main/master branches**
- All work must be done on feature/fix branches
- Use `scripts/create-issue-branch.sh <issue-number>` to create branches from issues
- Create branches manually if not using the script: `git checkout -b feature/123-description`
- Only merge branches via Pull Requests
