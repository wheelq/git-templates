# GitHub Actions Workflow: Close Issues on PR Merge
#
# This workflow automatically closes issues when a PR is merged if the PR
# description contains keywords like "Closes #123", "Fixes #123", etc.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Uncomment this workflow or copy it to your repository
# 2. Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled in repository settings
# 3. The workflow will run automatically when PRs are merged
#
# NOTE: GitHub already has built-in support for closing issues via keywords
# in PR descriptions. This workflow adds additional functionality like:
# - Custom notifications
# - Status updates
# - Integration with other tools
#
# If you only need basic issue closing, GitHub's built-in feature is sufficient.
# Just use keywords like "Closes #123" or "Fixes #123" in your PR description.
